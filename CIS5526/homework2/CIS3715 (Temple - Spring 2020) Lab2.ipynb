    "# Lab 2\n",
    "## Using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of Lab2 is to go through a demo for EDA of a relatively clean tabular data called *Auto MPG data*. This data set comes from the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) and can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG. We provide a slightly modified version of this data set as file `cars.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To load this data set and pursue EDA, it is a good idea to use several popular Python packages, which come preloaded with the Anaconda software:\n",
    "- pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/) -- a library for data science\n",
    "- numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) -- a library for data computations\n",
    "- matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/) -- a library for data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of *pandas* is its `DataFrame` data structure that provides an intuitive way of handling tabular data. The main feature of *numpy* is its `array` data structure that represents matrices and allows us to perform matrix algebra operations. *matplotlib* allows visualizing data stored in `DataFrame` or `array` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you will soon realize, each new Python library requires spending some time to learn about it. There are several nice tutorials that you can find on the web that get you started with the 3 libraries. A particularly great resource for learning about those libraries is your textbook *Python for Data Analysis*, so please take some time to browse its contents and try to run the code provided in it. When learning about the new libraries, you are best advised to jump in and immediatelly start tinkering with the code. The more time you spend using the library, the more you will uncover about all the great features and posibilities the library offers you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by loading the 3 libraries in a particular way that many data scientists prefer."
