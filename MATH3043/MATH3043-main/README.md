1.
Example 2 (This is lab work 1. Write the code in labwork1.m between "%% solution for Example 2" and "%% end of Example 2" then submit it via canvas)
(a) Given a polynomial p(x) = m*x^m+(m-1)*x^(m-1)+ ... +1*x+pi/4, m = 100,
write the code to use nested form computing p( pi/3 ) and p( sin(pi/40) ) by chopping/rounding to six digits (use the finite digit arithmetic functions in Example 1)
(b) Calculate the absolute and relative errors
